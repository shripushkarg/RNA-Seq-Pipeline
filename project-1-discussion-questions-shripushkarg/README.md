# Project 1 Discussion Questions

Instead of a full report, please instead answer the questions in this document to the best of your ability. 
They cover a range of topics both technical and conceptual and are meant to allow more focus on the 
underlying science behind what we've been doing. You should be able to work on these questions in any Rstudio
session, local or on the SCC, whichever you prefer. For the questions that require a diagram, please make the
diagram in any appropriate software and generate an image file. Add the image file to this directory and fill
in the provided `knitr::include_graphics()` markdown code chunk to display it inline. 

We've asked you to learn and integrate a multitude of different tools and ideas in a short amount of time for 
this first project. These questions will help me assess how well I've conveyed the material as well as help you
structure your thoughts on some conceptual, high-level questions related to RNAseq as a whole and the interpretation
of your preliminary results. 

These questions are due by next Monday 3/4/2024 along with the other tasks you were asked to complete for week 5.
Remember that I will be providing you comments and feedback on your answers and allowing you to resubmit this document.
Upon resubmission, if you address all of the comments and feedback, you will receive full participation for this first 
project.
